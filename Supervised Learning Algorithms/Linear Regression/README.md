**Linear regression is one of the ways to perform predictive analysis. It is used to examine regression estimates.**

The regression estimates explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The same is represented in the below equation.
The formula for linear Regression:

y = mx + c


Why we Use Linear Regression?
Linear regression is used to perform regression analysis. Below are the uses of regression analysis.
Help determine the strength of Predictors: This technique is used in sales and marketing.  Predictive analysis helps in understanding the relationship between the predictor and outcome variable (i.e. dose and effect).
Forecast the effect through Prediction: The change in the dependent variable will cause a difference in an independent variable.  For example, if you spend more money on marketing a product it can affect the sales to increase or decrease.
Trend Analysis / Forecasting: Regression analysis is used to predict future trends especially in the share market where there are fluctuations and inflation in prices.
Types of Linear Regression
Below are the 5 types of Linear regression:

1. Simple Linear Regression
Simple regression has one dependent variable (interval or ratio), one independent variable (interval or ratio or dichotomous). The example can be measuring a childâ€™s height every year of growth. The usual growth is 3 inches. Many such real-world examples can be categorized under simple linear regression.

2. Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple regression is used when we have two independent variables and one dependent variable. We can determine what effect the independent variables have on a dependent variable.
